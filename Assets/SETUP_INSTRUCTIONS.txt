LOG FILE WRITER SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

I've created a LogFileWriter script that will capture all Unity console logs and write them to a text file that you can easily copy from!

SETUP STEPS:
1. In Unity, create an empty GameObject in your scene:
   - Right-click in the Hierarchy window
   - Select "Create Empty"
   - Rename it to "LogFileWriter" (optional)

2. Add the LogFileWriter component to this GameObject:
   - Select the empty GameObject you just created
   - In the Inspector, click "Add Component"
   - Search for "LogFileWriter" and add it

3. Configure the settings (optional):
   - Log File Name: Default is "unity_console_logs.txt"
   - Max Log Entries: Default is 1000 (prevents file from getting too large)
   - Include Timestamp: Adds timestamps to each log entry
   - Include Log Type: Shows if it's a Log, Warning, or Error
   - Clear On Start: Clears the log file when Unity starts

USAGE:
- The log file will be saved to Unity's persistent data path
- The script will log the exact file location when it starts
- You can right-click on the LogFileWriter component and select:
  - "Clear Log File" to manually clear the log
  - "Open Log Folder" to open the folder containing the log file

FINDING YOUR LOG FILE:
The log file location will be printed to the console when the script starts.
Typical locations:
- Windows: %userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\[CompanyName]\[ProductName]\
- Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/[CompanyName]/[ProductName]/
- Linux: ~/.config/unity3d/[CompanyName]/[ProductName]/

The script captures ALL console output including:
- Debug.Log messages
- Debug.LogWarning messages  
- Debug.LogError messages
- System errors and exceptions

Now you can easily copy your logs from the text file instead of struggling with Unity's console!
